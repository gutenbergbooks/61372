<span class="i0">It was on Easter Monday, in ’Seventy-six,</span>
<span class="i0">In Freemantle the jailers were all in a fix,</span>

<span class="i0">There was racing and chasing and bother, you know,</span>
<span class="i0">For the Fenians had sliddered<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
                 right off in a row;</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! Wilson and Cranston and Hogan are gone,</span>
<span class="i0">With Darragh and Hassett and staunch Harrington;</span>
<span class="i0">For Collins and Johnston have opened the ball,</span>
<span class="i0">And to join in the dancing, out step Jones and Hall,</span>
<span class="i0">And they tripped to a tune that was far from being slow;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>

                 warders and soldiers are running a race</span>
<span class="i0">And the mounted policemen prepare to give chase;</span>
<span class="i0">In the pensioner’s barracks the trumpet did blow,</span>
<span class="i0">And old Finnerty’s<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>

<span class="i0">So what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There are two trotting teams on the Rockingham road,</span>
<span class="i0">From the gloom of a prison each bearing its load,</span>
<span class="i0">And full hearts are beating with freedom and joy,</span>
<span class="i0">As they sweep ’round the sand hills and through the Blackboy.</span>
<span class="i0">With the sunlight of Hope every face is aglow;</span>

                 may swagger to cover his fears</span>
<span class="i0">As they drag out the guns of the Perth volunteers;</span>
<span class="i0">But the Fenians are off; they may puff, pant and blow;</span>
<span class="i0">For what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Near Rockingham jetty, upon the white sand,</span>
<span class="i0">With revolvers and rifles the Fenians stand—</span>
<span class="i0">Gay, fearless and free, stepping into their boat;</span>
<span class="i0">Shove her off! then out oars! on the waters afloat!</span>
<span class="i0">Now a right saucy Yankee tar takes them in tow;</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Silvee and Toby and Mopsa give way,</span>
<span class="i0">For the good ship <i>Catalpa</i> lies out in the bay.</span>
<span class="i0">“Come down, you big Louis,” the captain did roar,</span>
<span class="i0">“Now what do you say, men? pull off from the shore;</span>
<span class="i0">You Lombar, keep stroke; pull, men, cheerily, oh!”</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now past Garden Island, and clear off the Sound,</span>
<span class="i0">Make sail on the boat, pass the liquor around;</span>
<span class="i0">Shift your seats, trim the boat, as she bends to the breeze,</span>
<span class="i0">And light as a sea-gull skims over the seas;</span>
<span class="i0">There’s a rest from the oar, while the fair breezes blow;</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At six in the evening we sighted the bark,</span>
<span class="i0">And we steered on her track till the evening grew dark,</span>
<span class="i0">When a squall coming down, with its venomous blast,</span>
<span class="i0">Almost swamped our good boat, as it tore out her mast;</span>
<span class="i0">So all night on the billows we tossed to and fro;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next morning at seven we raised her again,</span>
<span class="i0">Topsails, mainsails and hull—we were nearing her plain,</span>
<span class="i0">When we spied the <i>Georgette</i>, steaming out of the Sound,</span>
<span class="i0">And we knew by her course for the bark she was bound;</span>
<span class="i0">So we hauled down our sail, then lay to and lay low;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the <i>Georgette</i> passed by bearing down on our ship;</span>
<span class="i0">All safe for the present—now, boys, let her rip;</span>
<span class="i0">Then we pulled in her wake for to see what she’d do,</span>
<span class="i0">And beside the <i>Catalpa</i> we saw her heave to,</span>
<span class="i0">And lay alongside her ten minutes or so;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">See the <i>Georgette</i> steams off, and is running inshore;</span>
<span class="i0">Make sail on the boat, out with paddle and oar;</span>
<span class="i0">For with every sail set, on her course down the bay,</span>
<span class="i0">The good ship <i>Catalpa</i> is bearing away.</span>
<span class="i0">To gain on her now we’ve a hard row to hoe;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To follow our bark we were pulling amain,</span>
<span class="i0">When we saw the <i>Georgette</i> coming for us again.</span>
<span class="i0">In search of our boat she was steaming right back,</span>
<span class="i0">And we almost despaired as we lay in her track;</span>
<span class="i0">So we hauled down our sail and again we lay low;</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still nearer and nearer the steamer came on,</span>
<span class="i0">And our plan of escape seemed all shattered and gone;</span>
<span class="i0">Hope faded away to a very small speck,</span>
<span class="i0">As we saw her lookout and the men on her deck;</span>
<span class="i0">But she passed us unseen—Fate had ordered it so;</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the steamer passed on, and was soon out of sight;</span>
<span class="i0">Boys, now for the bark, we must catch her ere night;</span>
<span class="i0">Every stroke is for freedom—pull fast, and pull strong—</span>
<span class="i0">Pull, fellows, together and send her along;</span>
<span class="i0">See the bark change her course, heading for us I trow;</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was two in the evening, and everything clear,</span>
<span class="i0">The bark coming to us, and nothing to fear,</span>
<span class="i0">When a sail on our lee, standing out from the shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Set us pulling our strongest with paddle and oar;</span>
<span class="i0">It’s a race for the ship, men; then row, bullies, row!</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With the sail on our lee, heading on for the ship,</span>
<span class="i0">We pulled strong and steady, and gave her the slip;</span>
<span class="i0">For beside the <i>Catalpa</i> we tossed oars at three,</span>
<span class="i0">With the water-police boat close up on her lee.</span>
<span class="i0">Quick on deck now, my lads! It was just “touch and go;”</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hoist the star-spangled banner, the flag of the free!</span>
<span class="i0">The brightest and best that waves over the sea:</span>
<span class="i0">May its stars ever brighten, its shadow increase,</span>
<span class="i0">Then a fig for John Bull and his water-police.</span>
<span class="i0">Wear ship! then for sea, blow you fair breezes, blow!</span>
<span class="i0">And what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here’s a health to brave Anthony, pass it along,</span>
<span class="i0">May his fortune be great, and his name live in song;</span>
<span class="i0">Here’s to Smith, our first-mate, fill your glasses with glee,</span>
<span class="i0">For a right manly, true-hearted sailor is he.</span>
<span class="i0">Here’s success to the cause that we all of us know;</span>
<span class="i0">But what’s that to any one, whether or no?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here’s the good ship <i>Catalpa</i>, and all her ship’s crew;</span>
<span class="i0">Land of felons and jailers, here’s to you adieu,</span>
<span class="i0">From your dry, sandy shores we are speeding away,</span>
<span class="i0">May your fortune be brighter at no distant day;</span>
<span class="i0">Here’s the land of the free, may it flourish and grow,—</span>
<span class="i0">And God prosper old Ireland wherever we go.</span>

<div class="chapter"><h2>The Cruise of the Catalpa.</h2></div>
<p class="f120"><i>A Song written on the Homeward Voyage,<br />and dedicated to the Crew.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I’m Irish, if you like, and perhaps my name is Mike;</span>
<span class="i0">I’m a land-crab, and but little of a sailor;</span>
<span class="i0">So, for want of better news, now I’ll tell you of a cruise</span>
<span class="i0">I once took on board a simple Yankee whaler.</span>
<span class="i0">From New Bedford she was bound to the Western whaling ground,</span>
<span class="i0">Where they said the whales were always found in plenty;</span>
<span class="i0">So a willing son of toil, in the hope of striking oil,</span>
<span class="i0">I shipped, the greenest hand amongst the twenty.</span>
<span class="i0">Our old barque was staunch and sound, copper-fastened and well found,—</span>
<span class="i0">When I call her old, don’t think that I deride her;</span>
<span class="i0">Catalpa was her name, and when first on board I came,</span>
<span class="i0">I can tell you it was rather “rough on Snyder;”</span>
<span class="i0">For the captain and the mate, they were up both soon and late,</span>
<span class="i0">And around the decks kept hollering and bawling;</span>
<span class="i0">Though I wasn’t very sick, faith I’d rather cut my stick,</span>
<span class="i0">Than those blasted ropes eternally keep hauling.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Chorus.</i>—Pass the bottle, if you please, now we’re sitting at our ease,</span>
<span class="i12">Let us moisten up till song flows ripe and mellow;</span>
<span class="i10">Here’s to every honest lass, and together as they pass,</span>
<span class="i12">Here’s a health to every honest, manly fellow!</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well we weathered out a gale, when we captured our first whale,</span>
<span class="i0">And a bully hundred-barreller we got;</span>
<span class="i0">May I never die in sin, when it came to cutting-in,</span>
<span class="i0">All hell was there to pay, and no pitch hot;</span>
<span class="i0">For the skipper stamped and tore, and the mates they jumped and swore,</span>
<span class="i0">When they might as well just take it cool and easy;</span>
<span class="i0">And the way the blubber flew round the decks among the crew,</span>
<span class="i0">You’d imagine every man of them was crazy.</span>
<span class="i0">So we cruised the season out where the sperm-whales did spout,</span>
<span class="i0">And I learned what cutting-in and trying-out meant;</span>
<span class="i0">When, on a friendly call, we anchored at Fayal,</span>
<span class="i0">And sent our oil on shore there for transhipment.</span>
<span class="i0">Then we hoisted sail again, bound for the Spanish main,</span>
<span class="i0">Six months upon hard-tack, salt beef and pork.</span>
<span class="i0">Some may like a sailor’s life, but I’d rather have a wife,</span>
<span class="i0">And the humblest little shanty in New York.</span>
<span class="i18"><i>Chorus.</i>—Pass the bottle round, etc.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Steering for the river Platte, so the captain and the mate</span>
<span class="i0">Told us, green ones, who inquired where we were going;</span>
<span class="i0">But eastward, day by day, we kept bearing still away,</span>
<span class="i0">And where he meant to stop there was no knowing.</span>
<span class="i0">So the shellbacks then began to growl at the “old man,”</span>
<span class="i0">Steering for the river Platte in such a manner;</span>
<span class="i0">But as little did they know where the skipper meant to go,</span>
<span class="i0">As a puppy dog of etiquette or grammar.</span>
<span class="i0">Well, we sighted land at last, and soon our anchor cast,</span>
<span class="i0">But to name the place, I guess, my friends, would fail ye;</span>
<span class="i0">For the land to which we bore, and where we went ashore,</span>
<span class="i0">Was Bunbury, in Western Australia.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We entered for recruits, wood, water, fish and fruits,</span>
<span class="i0">Spuds, onions, and our liberty on shore;</span>
<span class="i0">In a fortnight, well prepared, scrubbed, painted and repaired,</span>
<span class="i0">We hoisted sail and put to sea once more.</span>
<span class="i18"><i>Chorus.</i>—Pass the bottle round, etc.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then the joy began for every Irishman,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose soul indignant spurns at British slavery,</span>
<span class="i0">Who hates the tyrant guile, and the cunning, low and vile,</span>
<span class="i0">That fosters cant, hypocrisy and knavery.</span>
<span class="i0">Six Irish soldiers brave, rescued from the living grave,</span>
<span class="i0">In which the cursed spite of England bound them,</span>
<span class="i0">Life and liberty to save, came flying o’er the wave,</span>
<span class="i0">And along with our bold skipper there we found them.</span>
<span class="i0">Then the British lion roared for his captives; and, on board</span>
<span class="i0">A steamer, sent out soldiery to find them;</span>
<span class="i0">Police and volunteers, great guns and cannoneers,</span>
<span class="i0">To capture, and once more in fetters bind them.</span>
<span class="i0">They followed us all day, and we couldn’t get away,</span>
<span class="i0">For the wind was light, and blowing on the land;</span>
<span class="i0">And we tacked all through the night, till the early morning light</span>
<span class="i0">Showed the steamer coming for us close at hand.</span>
<span class="i18"><i>Chorus.</i>—Pass the bottle, etc.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was useless strife to wage, she had got the weather-gage,</span>
<span class="i0">On the wind she couldn’t hope to outsail her;</span>
<span class="i0">So we held upon our course, to see what moral force</span>
<span class="i0">They’d try upon the simple Yankee whaler.</span>
<span class="i0">Then hot in haste and rage, all ready to engage,</span>
<span class="i0">They came like bloodhounds straining at the slip,</span>
<span class="i0">And the boss of all these jailers, to frighten us poor sailors,</span>
<span class="i0">Fired a round shot from his cannon at our ship.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We never cracked a lay, on our course still bore away,</span>
<span class="i0">And he found we wouldn’t scare worth a cent;</span>
<span class="i0">So another dodge he tried, but we knew the beggar lied,</span>
<span class="i0">When he said he’d orders from our government.</span>
<span class="i0">Then like a puffing pig, he strutted very big,</span>
<span class="i0">On his quarter-deck, and loudly gave us warning,</span>
<span class="i0">That he’d blow us to the devil, which wasn’t very civil</span>
<span class="i0">To lads who’d been up early in the morning.</span>
<span class="i18"><i>Chorus.</i>—Pass the bottle, etc.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he found us rather fly, alive, quite pert, and spry,</span>
<span class="i0">Cool and ready for this boast, right little caring,</span>
<span class="i0">And our answer soon went back, as upon the starboard tack,</span>
<span class="i0">Right down upon his broadside we came bearing;</span>
<span class="i0">For we knew our cause was just, so in God we put our trust,</span>
<span class="i0">For Liberty, all threats and danger scorning;</span>
<span class="i0">And o’er our heads there flew Freedom’s flag, red, white and blue,</span>
<span class="i0">Streaming gaily in the breeze, our peak adorning.</span>
<span class="i0">Then he hailed us once again, having blustered all in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">With a mild request to let him come on board;</span>
<span class="i0">But our captain answered no; “it would never do for Joe;”</span>
<span class="i0">At sea to stop, he couldn’t well afford.</span>
<span class="i0">So they left us in despair, and skulked off to their lair,</span>
<span class="i0">Whilst our starry flag with joyful hearts we hail her,</span>
<span class="i0">For the lion dropped his tail, and his growl became a wail,</span>
<span class="i0">When bearded by a simple Yankee whaler.</span>
<span class="i18"><i>Chorus.</i>—Pass the bottle, etc.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I’m Irish if you like, and perhaps my name is <i>Mike</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">I’m a land-crab, and but little of a sailor;</span>
<span class="i0">From the Western whaling ground, all safe and homeward bound,</span>
<span class="i0">On board a little, saucy Yankee whaler.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<span class="i0">You may say I’ve lots of cheek, aye, and maybe call me <i>Greek</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">Though I never knew Omega yet from Alpha;</span>
<span class="i0">But I’ve sailed the world around, on the goose you’ll find I’m sound,</span>
<span class="i0">And I’ve cruised aboard the gallant old <i>Catalpa</i>.</span>
<span class="i0">Pass the bottle, if you please, now we’re sitting at our ease,</span>
<span class="i0">Let us moisten up till song flows ripe and mellow;</span>
<span class="i0">Here’s to every honest lass, and as on through life they pass,</span>
<span class="i0">Here’s a health to every honest, manly fellow.</span>
